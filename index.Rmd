# About this site

This website is the official site for the project, *Analysis of Time-varying Brain Dynamics and Cognitive Correlates*. The project is led by [Professor Seonjoo Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/seonjool/) from Columbia University. Yiling Yang, a 2nd year MS Biostatistics student also from Columbia University, performed the major analysis. Their contact information can be found at the end of this page. The website is for introduction of the project and make code and slides open sources to those who are interested in this topic.

# Data

There are three datasets involved in this projects. Demographic and Neuropsychological scores were required before the fMRI study. In later analysis, neuropsychological score will be considered as primary interests or dependent variable. Demographic contains age information for each subject, which is used as an adjustment for regression analysis. The fMRI data were used for clustering analysis and derivation of dynamic metrics (introduce later), which mainly served as independent variables in later analysis.

# Preprocessing & Clulstering Analysis

Before any analysis, we removed first and last 14 time points data due to the effect of filtering. To capture the phase of BOLD signal, we performed *Hilbert Transformation*, a decomposition method. Cosine distance metrices at each time point. For such distance metrix at each time point, we performed *PCA* and kept the *1st* eigenvector only. Since dist nce matrix is diagnoal, the speed of processing can be significantly improved. Data entries were reduced from $N^2$ to ${N(N-1)}\over{2}$. After removed some subjects with incorrect measured length and too much head motion, we performed *K-means* and *Gaussian Mixture Model* clustering on stacked dataset of every subject. For K-means, *Dunn Index* was used for hyperparameter tuning. Lastly, *hierarchical clustering* was used to review similarities between clusters found by K-means and GMM.
